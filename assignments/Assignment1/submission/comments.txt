- Driver doesn't need a driver's license, as specificed in the description.
- Don't agree with the ternary relationship between Traffic Officer, Ticket,
  and Vehicle Registration. This implies that you need a traffic officer to
  issue the ticket, the description says a ticket can be issues without an
  officer.
- The two relationships between Person and Marriage imply that a person can be
  married to themselves since a single Person can participate in the Partner 1
  relationship as well as the Partner 2 relationship.

- The requirement says CAN have license(s), meaning the driver could have 0 or
  more licenses. They don't need one, and they can have multiple.
- License's classes don't need to be assigned to a license. Nothing in the
  description indicates that all classes need to be in use.
- Maybe demerit noitce should have a weak key of date?
- Not sure if vehicle registration should share the same parent as birth record
  and marriage record. They seem like separate legal entities with different
  purposes
- Ternary relationship between mother, father, and birth implies that you need
  a father, which the requirements say you don't.
- Entity for mother and father is redundant because there are no additional
  attributes added.

- Demerit_point_notice should have to participate in the has_notice
  relationship. Notice needs a driver.
- Demerit_point_notice should be a weak entity because it cannot exist without
  a driver.
- To me it makes sense that a driver can only have one license and not many,
  because that's how Alberta traffic law works.
- For the ticket and registered vehicle relationship, there should be an arrow
  between the relationship and registered vehicle. This is because a ticket
  can only belong to one vehicle, but a vehicle can receive many tickets.
- I would remove the ternary relationship between Ticket, Registered_vehicle,
  and Traffic_officer.
- I don't agree with father being an attribute. You don't know the details that
  the person would have, you would just know the name.
- Can relationships have a key attribute? Just a question.
- There should be a participation constraint on birth and mother, because every
  mother needs to have given birth to become a mother.
- Partner and marriage should have a different participation constraint. If you
  are a partner, you are married, but if a Person is in the marriage
  relationship, this model prevents the Person from having another marriage
  later.

- Based on the requirements, a driver should be able to have multiple licenses,
  regardless of what is true in Alberta law.
- Driver's license should only have one driver, not multiple drivers.
- For the Traffic_officer, Ticket, and Registered_vehicle ternary
  relationships, a traffic officer cannot give a different ticket to the same
  vehicle.
- Registered_vehicle is NOT a car. It inherits the attributes of Vehicle
  like year and color, which is not appropriate for a record. The vehicle has
  these attributes but not the registration itself.
- Mother is kind of redundant because there are no additional attributes that
  distinguish it from a person.
- Why are person and partner different? How do you define who's the partner and
  who's the person? Seems arbitrary.

- The way marriage records is implemented does not restrict a person from
  marrying himself or herself
- For Demerit Point Notice, would notice date in combination with description
  better for weak keys?
- I really like the way the relationship between Tickets, Traffic Officer, and
  Registered Vehicle is done.

Comments from haiyang3

- Record should not be the parent entity of Birth and Mariage, as they can be
  managed by different departments.
- Notice date of Demerit Point Notice is set as weak key, how would we record
  the case when a driver got multiple notices in a day.
- Shouldn't entity names be singular?
