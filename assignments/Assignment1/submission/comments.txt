-Driver doesn't need a driver's license, as specificed in the
description
-Don't agree with the ternary relationship between Traffic Officer,
Ticket, and Vehicle Registration. This implies that you need a 
traffic officer to issue the ticket, which the description does not 
say.
-The two relationships between Person and Marriage imply that
a person can be married to themselves since a single Person can 
participate in the Partner 1 relationship and the Partner 2 relationship

-The requirements also say CAN have license(s), meaning the driver
could have 0 or more licenses. They don't need one, and they can
have multiple
-License's classes don't need to be assigned to a license. Nothing
in the description indicates that all classes need to be in use
-Maybe demerit noitce should have a weak key of date?
-Not sure if vehicle registration should share the same parent as 
birth record and marriage record. They seem like separate legal
entities with different purposes
-Ternary relationship between mother, father and birth implies that
you need a father, which the requirements say you don't.S
-Entity for mother and father is redundant because there are no
additional attributes added.

-Demerit-point-notice should have to participate in the has_notice
relationship. Notice needs a driver.
-Demerit-point-notice should be a weak entity because it cannot
exist without a driver.
-To me it makes sense that a driver can only have license, because
that's how it is in Alberta law.
-For the ticket and registered vehicle relationship, there should
be an arrow between the relationship and registered vehicle. This
is because a ticket only belonds to one vehicles, and many tickets
can still be given to a vehicle.
-I would remove the ternary relationship between Ticket,
Registered_vehicle, and TrafficOfficer.
-I don't agree with father being an attribute. You don't know the
details that a person should have, you would just know the name.
-Can relationships have a key attribute? Just a question.
-There should be a participation constraint on birth and mother,
because every mother needs to have given birth to become a mother
-Partner and marriage should have a participation constraint.
If you are a partner, you are married
-Person can't marry again. Doesn't allow for multiple marriages

-Based on the requirements, a driver should be able to have multiple
licenses, regardless of what is true in Alberta law.
-Driver's license should only have one driver, not multiple drivers.
-For the traffic officer, ticket, and registered vehicle ternary 
relationships, a traffic officer cannot give a different ticket
to the same vehicle.
-Registered vehicle is NOT a car. It inherits the attributes of the
vehicles like year and color, which is not appropriate for a 
record. The vehicle has these attributes but not the registration
itself
-Mother is kind of redundant because there are no additional attributes
that distinguish it from a person
-Why are person and partner different? How do you define who's the
partner and who's the person? Seems arbitrary.
