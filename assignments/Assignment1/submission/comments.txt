-Driver doesn't need a driver's license, as specificed in the
description
-Don't agree with the ternary relationship between Traffic Officer,
Ticket, and Vehicle Registration. This implies that you need a 
traffic officer to issue the ticket, which the description does not 
say.
-The two relationships between Person and Marriage imply that
a person can be married to themselves since a single Person can 
participate in the Partner 1 relationship and the Partner 2 relationship

-The requirements also say CAN have license(s), meaning the driver
could have 0 or more licenses. They don't need one, and they can
have multiple
-License's classes don't need to be assigned to a license. Nothing
in the description indicates that all classes need to be in use
-Maybe demerit noitce should have a weak key of date?
-Not sure if vehicle registration should share the same parent as 
birth record and marriage record. They seem like separate legal
entities with different purposes
-Ternary relationship between mother, father and birth implies that
you need a father, which the requirements say you don't.S
-Entity for mother and father is redundant because there are no
additional attributes added
